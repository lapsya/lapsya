### Just for fun

* [100 days of code](https://github.com/lapsya/100daysofcode) challenge: small scripts and projects on vaious topics to improve programming skills
* [GitHub Graduation 2020](https://github.com/lapsya/graduation) entry
* [Drone autopilot](https://github.com/lapsya/super-drone-2016): [ROS](https://www.ros.org/)-powered autopilot that directs the drone to fly towards a light flickering with specific frequency for the purpose of drug delivery through a window
